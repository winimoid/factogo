# Feature Specification: Version-Aware Onboarding

**Feature Branch**: `002-implement-a-version`  
**Created**: 2025-09-29  
**Status**: Clarified  
**Input**: User description: "Implement a version-aware onboarding system for new users and application updates."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29
- Q: The initial setup guide for new users is mandatory. For existing users who update the app, should the "What's New" tutorial also be mandatory, or should they be able to skip it? → A: Mandatory: Users must view the entire "What's New" tutorial before accessing the app.
- Q: If a new user quits the app in the middle of the initial (mandatory) setup process, what should happen when they reopen the app? → A: Resume: The user should be taken back to the exact step where they left off.
- Q: When storing the "setup completed" version, what data should we save? → A: Object with Date: An object including the version and the completion date, e.g., {version: "1.2.0", completedAt: "2025-09-29T10:00:00Z"}. This allows for future analytics.
- Q: This is an edge case, but important for reliability. If the app fails to read the version from the package.json file for any reason, how should it behave? → A: Fail Safe: Assume the versions match and proceed directly to the main app to avoid blocking the user. Log an error in the background.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a new user, I want to be guided through the essential initial setup steps so that I can configure the application correctly before I start using it.
As an existing user, I want to be notified of new features after an update so that I can discover and take advantage of them.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has installed the app for the first time and has no setup version stored, **When** they open the app after authenticating, **Then** they MUST be shown a mandatory, multi-step setup guide.
2. **Given** a user is in the initial setup guide, **When** they complete the final step, **Then** the main application home screen MUST be displayed and the current app version and completion date MUST be saved.
3. **Given** a user has previously completed the setup for version 1.1.0, **When** they update the app to 1.2.0 and open it, **Then** they MUST be shown a mandatory tutorial specific to the new features in version 1.2.0.
4. **Given** a user is on app version 1.2.0 and has already completed the setup/update tutorial for this version, **When** they open the app, **Then** they MUST be taken directly to the main application screen.

### Edge Cases
- **Quitting Initial Setup**: If a user quits the app midway through the initial setup, the system MUST return them to the step where they left off upon next launch.
- **Version Read Failure**: If the system fails to read the application version from `package.json`, it MUST log an error and proceed to the main application to avoid blocking the user.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST, on app startup, compare the current app version from `package.json` with a `setupCompletedForVersion` value stored in `AsyncStorage`.
- **FR-002**: If no `setupCompletedForVersion` value is found, the system MUST redirect the user to a mandatory initial setup navigator after authentication.
- **FR-003**: The initial setup flow MUST guide the user through, at a minimum, creating a store, providing a store name, and selecting a document template.
- **FR-004**: Upon successful completion of the initial setup flow, the system MUST save an object containing the current application version and the completion timestamp as the `setupCompletedForVersion` value in `AsyncStorage`.
- **FR-005**: If the stored `setupCompletedForVersion` value is less than the current application version, the system MUST display a mandatory, version-specific update tutorial flow.
- **FR-006**: After a user completes an update tutorial, the system MUST update the `setupCompletedForVersion` value in `AsyncStorage` to an object containing the current application version and completion timestamp.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Onboarding State**: Represents the user's progress through onboarding.
  - `version` (String): The application version for which the tutorial was completed.
  - `completedAt` (ISO 8601 Timestamp): The date and time the tutorial was completed.
