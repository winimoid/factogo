# Phase 0: Research

## Summary

The feature specification is comprehensive and provides sufficient detail to proceed with the design and implementation phases. The key decisions regarding data models, user flows, and the migration plan are well-defined.

No outstanding questions or ambiguities block the planning process. All technical choices will be based on the existing project stack and conventions as outlined in the constitution.

## Key Decisions (Pre-defined)

- **State Management**: React Context API (per constitution).
- **Database**: `react-native-sqlite-storage` (inferred from existing project dependencies).
- **Styling**: React Native StyleSheet with theming context (per constitution).
- **Navigation**: React Navigation (per project context).
